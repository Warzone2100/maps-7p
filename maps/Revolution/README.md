Once a city straddling three states... Now a militarized ground wracked by conflict. 

During the calamity much of the city was wiped out, but some structures were adequately enough preserved.

That benefactor's one request - to crush any whom would enter the territory or otherwise threaten his sway over it.

This is a mostly asymmetric map with varying challenges and opportunities posed for awaiting players in various starting positions. Also a strong Scavenger presence, and a good deal of map character.
